# Image Manipulation Project

If you're looking to create and modify images using Java, look no further than this versatile application! 
You can easily trim the borders of your images, create negative colour versions, stretch them horizontally, shrink them vertically, invert them, apply colour filters, 
paint images with random colours, draw rectangles on images, and even create abstract geometric art using rectangles. 
All of these Methods rely on 2D arrays and are perfect for anyone interested in exploring the creative potential of Java programming.
